# Bootstrap & Ember

This is the source for a little presentation I did for the SLC Ember.js meetup on April 24, 2014.  There are two main branches: master contains the finished product complete with comments explaining what we are doing and the "starting-point" branch represents a basic website before ember and bootstrap where integrated.

It might help to [view this commit](https://github.com/brettv/ember---bootstrap/commit/52feca503d1c374497976e50aed6db3214724d16).  It shows all the changes required to take the app from the "starting-point" to the finished product.
